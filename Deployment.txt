This project contains the Prediction-Based Dynamic SMT Threading (PBDST) framework for POWER8 processors.

How to deploy the PBDST framework?

Preparations:

1. Make sure that users have sbt version 2.10 or above, which is used to compile Spark. 
The framework is integrated into Spark, so we provide the patch file for users to deploy 
the framework. User should download the Spark source code from the official web site. 
Spark version 1.3.0 has been tested, which is also preferred. Other version may have problems.

2. Our model only support Pseudo-distributed mode. So the Spark should be deployed in standalone mode.

3. Make sure that the POWER8 system has Linux perf.  

Deployment:

1. After applying the patch file PBDST.patch to Spark 
source code, users need to compile Spark, which can 
reference to Spark official web site.

2. copy the PBDST folder to /home/

Executing Spark applications:

The framework is transparent to user applications. So users just need to submit a Spark applications
as without the framework.
